;;; Commentary:

;; Go-present-mode is a major mode for viewing and editing Go present
;; files (mainly slides). It strives to provide view and features
;; consistent with Go present tool web view.
;;
;;
;; Installation
;; ------------
;; (add-to-list 'load-path "path/to/go-present-mode/")
;; (require 'go-present-mode)
;;
;;
;; Installation with use-package
;; -----------------------------
;; (use-package go-present-mode
;;   :load-path "path/to/go-present-mode/")
;;
;;
;; Features
;; --------
;;
;; Standard Emacs mode features such as: syntax highlighting via
;; font-lock, commenting/uncommeting, imenu support, and defun
;; movement.
;;
;; Outline-mode integration:
;;    C-c C-o C-h         collapse all headlines
;;    C-c C-o C-s         show all headlines
;;    C-c C-o C-n         go to next headline
;;    C-c C-o C-p         go to previous headline
;;
;; Present and allow editing (C-c C-p C-l) links.
;;
;; Open slide at point in a web browser (C-c C-p C-p).
;;
;; Show inline images (toggle with C-c C-p C-i).
;;
;; Open thing at point (C-c C-p C-o) such as: image, code, link.
;;
;; Toggle fonts
;;   C-c C-p C-`         program
;;   C-c C-p C-*         bold
;;   C-c C-p C-_         italic
;;
;; Show preformatted text as such.
;;
;; Show inline code (C-c C-p C-v) as specified by .code
;; commands. Support:
;;   - Address handling, OMIT lines, line numbers, and highlights.
;;   - Modifying code inline.
;;   - Executing code at point (C-c C-p C-c).
;;   - Tracking changes to the underlying file.
